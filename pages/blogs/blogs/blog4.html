<p>well uhhhhhhhhhhhhh hi lol</p>

<p>its definetly been a bit since i done a blog post but in other words......</p>

<p>ive slacked a LOT on this site cus i lowk forgot about it majority of the time lol</p>

<p>im not *too* focussed on doin anything too major with it, it mostly just a fun thing to show to friends every once and a while and see what shit i put on it lol</p>

<p>i have reworked the site a little bit to incorporate the other pages into the main page design (just look at these images itll make more sense trust) to get rid of the soulless void behind everything lol</p>

<p>website shit aside i've mostly just been dreading being at school practicing my art and allat</p>

<p>my main goal tbh rn is to eventually post an animation or drawing on my newgrounds since theres NOTHING on there.....</p>

<p>anyways uhh merry christmas and happy holiday and allat</p>

<p>dont be a FUCKING grinch</p>

<p>(also fnf week 8 PLEASE come out we've been waiting for eons we NEED this)</p>
