<p>yeah remember the last blog post i made a year ago? no? well FUCK that i'm BACK on html</p>

<p>as of right now i've mainly just been working on the main page so the other pages might be a lil outdated empty n soulless (i haven't even started on some woops!!!) so jus ignore those lol but don't worry i'll get to that at some point</p>
    
<p>i don't know if i'm really *done* with the main page design since i can't think of much more to add but i'm still really proud of what i have now since it's a huge leap compared to past iterations of this site and that i'm finally getting off my slackin ass teehee</p>
    
<p>if i ever really do get far with this site i'm really digging the idea of buying my own domain for it too since they are pretty affordable n to make it look nice and clean</p>
    
<p>oh yeah on the topic of blogs.... i'll *probably* just have em on the main page from now on rather than having their own separate page for it since it pretty empty over there and also that i'm not the best of keeping track of stuff but thas future me's problem lol</p>
