<p>Smokey is a gray and white cat who is very energetic and playful while also a fat lazy bum who sits on his ass all day and whines at you.</p>

<p>Smokey gets really competitive when you play games with him or when he's playing with Princess, he'll resort to anything to catch the toy on the string, even star-jumping at you.</p>

<p>Smokey trills and meows a lot compared to Princess, he'll make a noise over literally everything.</p>

<p>Mostly food.</p>
