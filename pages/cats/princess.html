<p>Princess is a 4 year old tortoiseshell who is very shy but loving.</p>

<p>Princess LOVES pets and cuddles but she HATES people she doesn't know, whenever guests come over she always hides somewhere until the house is cleared.</p>

<p>Princess is very quiet, she doesn't make much noise at all, usually a couple small squeaks here and there when she yawns or stretches, but when she meows you'll definetly hear it.</p>

<p>She'll BEG for pets sometimes even going out of her way to meow at us for them.</p>

<p>Also Smokey bullies her and hits her but princess ends up winning most of the fights.</p>
